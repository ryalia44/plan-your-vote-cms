# Plan Your Vote

## What is Plan Your Vote
Plan Your Vote (PYV) is an open source project created by Medhat Elmasry & BCIT CST Information Systems students inspired by City of Vancouver's [app](https://vancouver.ca/plan-your-vote/index.aspx). PYV is intended to be a generic content management system (CMS) and content delivery application (CDA) for voting systems.
